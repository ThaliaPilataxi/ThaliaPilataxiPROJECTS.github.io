								<h2>	ABOUT ME<br /> </h2>
								<p align="justify"> I am a civil engineer graduated at the University of Twente.  
								I like to describe myself as passionate and responsible. I am always trying to learn and discover how to 
								make life easier through engineering. Through my studies, I have gained experience in the fields of Systems Engineering and Structural 
							    Mechanics, which are areas of my interest. At the same time, I have elaborated several models in Matlab to find solutions to diverse problems. Whereas, my 
							    professional experience has provided me with the necessary knowlegde to improve my management and design skills.    </p>

								<h2>Parking Garage - Kop van Boulevard<br /> </h2> 
								
								<p align="justify">The project of Module 4 was dedicated to the design of a new parking garage for the municipality of Enschede, which
                                    also consisted of storage units. Four important aspects where considered for the design of the parking garage: (1) System Engineering; 
                                    (2) Structural Design; (3) Circular Economy and Sustainability; and (4) Finance. For more details check the report

								<h2>Design of miter gates and a pedestrian bridge<br />

								<p>Module 6 was dedicated to design a convenient, safe, efficient and sustainable system which should function in a fully energy-neutral manner. Therefore,
									the project was divided in two parts: the first part was focused on the design method and strategy, and structural mechanics. The second pat was 
									focused on the environmental and economic sustainability, social sustainability, and energy use in the build environment.  For more technical details see 
									the report of the first part

								<h2>Vegetation monitoring with remote sensing<br />
								</h2>
								<p> Module 9 of my bachelor studies was dedicated to creating a physical scale model of a multifunctional flood defence by an
                                    interdisciplinary team in which each member studied a specific topic in-depth. I studied remote sensing
                                    vegetation management by using satellite data with Google Earth Engine. The information was used
                                    to develop land-use classification maps and vegetation management strategies.

								<h2>Smart Infrastructure Exploration<br />
								</h2>
								<p> There is uncertainty about the exact location of onderground utilities, since different parties such as municipalities and utility companies manage different information about their exact location. Therefore, in Module 10 a smart city engineering project was carried out, 
                                    which was focused on how to elaborate a 3D model of such utilities
                                    considering the uncertainty of their exact location. Such project should help to determine the exact location of utilities, in case there is conflicting information between the different parties. More details can be found

								<h2>Paving and Compaction Support Systems -
									The status of implementation worldwide
									<br />
								</h2>
								<p>
                                    This research focused on reporting the state-of-the-art of paving and compaction support systems
                                    worldwide. Therefore, their evolution and introduction within road construction regulations were studied.
                                    The retrieved information served to analyse the enablers and barriers to their implementation. Finally,
                                    recommendations for the fast-tracked implementation of these high-tech solutions were elaborated. The thesis can be found
